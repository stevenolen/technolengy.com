Some background: I really, really love <a href="https://github.com/Nordstrom/chef-vault">chef-vault</a>. Apparently this morning I also really forgot how it works when I stupidly reset my chef
private key. In case you ever make this amazing mistake, here’s how I went about resolving&nbsp;it!</p>

          <section class="content"><p>I’ve had the great opportunity in the past 4 or so months to really get going with chef, and writing automated infrastructure.
It’s an incredibly deep world/community filled with loads of wonderful people and tools.  One of the best tools for writing
quality chef cookbooks is <a href="http://kitchen.ci">Test Kitchen</a>. Test Kitchen by default uses a vagrant/virtual box environment to
quickly converge and test a chef cookbook.  But I’m ready to push this forward with docker for speed of convergence! Even better,
I use a mac for my local machine and the docker team released an awesome beta of <a href="https://kitematic.com/">Kitematic</a> to facilitate docker
containers on Mac <span class="caps">OS</span>. Getting them set up together requires very little effort, but I wanted to note it here in case it was&nbsp;helpful! </p>

So I moved the content to a <a href="http://wintersmith.io">wintersmith</a> template and hooked into a <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a> build to send the compiled
static content back to github for hosting on github pages. Here’s how I did&nbsp;it!</p>

As with most new system implementations in a group as small as mine is, we can hit the ground running and just make changes/adjust as needed.  This one made me a bit frustrated, so I figured I’d share in case it helped someone&nbsp;else.  </p>
